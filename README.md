# CensusVariableBrowser
A tool to find data on the census api

Right now this tool just navigates a file structure to see what variables are available for a given census API data series.  It checks for an API key but that isn't necessary right now.  I plan to continue developing this so that it will structure the API requests (using the key), perform them and save the data to csv format.
